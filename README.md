This repo is an analysis I did after creating my submission to Kaggle's March Madness Competition.

The anaylsis has to do with picking the best strategy for winning (placing in the top five for '16 competition) and I specifically looked at maximizing the prize money to win.

See http://stat-comp-newbie.blogspot.com/2016/03/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble-in-kaggles.html for the analysis.
