This repo is an analysis I did after creating my submission to Kaggle's March Madness Competition.

The analysis has to do with picking the best strategy for maximizing the amount of money won in the competition.

This repo contains the R script that I used for simulation. See http://stat-comp-newbie.blogspot.com/2016/03/to-gamble-or-not-to-gamble-in-kaggles.html for the analysis.
